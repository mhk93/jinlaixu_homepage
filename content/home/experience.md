+ Reviewed related literatures (mainly in Cloud Computing)
+ Constructed the cloud computing platform for our faculty:

	- Designed the virtualization solution for the cluster. (based on Xen)
	- Deployed Hadoop and related application(Hive, Spark, Solr ...) on the cluster.
	- Supported the experiment of Deep Learning in our lab.
+ Studied MapReduce programming model and did research on it:

	- Read the source code of MapReduce in Hadoop project.
	- Proposed a new method to reuse the intermediate results automatically and data-awarenessly and implemented the prototype system by modifying the core code of MapReduce.
	- Evaluated the performance on the cluster and got the result that the system could improve the performance up to 24.6% compared with the previous optimization work.
	- The paper is published on CCPE. (Title: MEMoMR: Accelerate MapReduce via reuse of intermediate results)
	
+ Managed the cluster in our faculty:

	- Allocated the virtual machines and network resource.
	- Supported a mirror site on the cluster (http://mirrors.cug.edu.cn)."""

+ Reviewed related literatures (mainly in Computer Vision and Robotics).
+ Participated in The 9 th Robot Soccer Tournament of China and The Tryouts for FIRA in Changchun in freshmen year.
+ Studied the architecture and implementation of ROS(The Robot Operating System) and preliminarily deployed it on the robots control panel (Version: RB100 by RoBoard).
+ Successfully applied for The National College Students Innovation Experiment Program (with funding):

	- Topic: Small Model Aircraft Autopilot System and Aerial Photo Research
	- Chose Quadrotor(an aircraft with four rotors) as the carrier platform of the research.
	- Studied the theory of balancing the Quadrotor with MikroKopter(one of the most famous open source UAV projects).
	- Studied and implemented the point clouds registration algorithm ICP and RANSAC on ROS.
	- Used ASUS Xtion PRO (a device like Kinect) to get the point cloud data and evaluated the algorithm.
	- Wrote graduation thesis based on this topic.(Title: the Design and Implementation of the Quadrotor Autopilot and 3-D Point Cloud Generation and Processing System)"""
